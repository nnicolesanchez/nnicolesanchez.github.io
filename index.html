	      Natalie “Nicole” Sanchez is a finishing PhD candidate at the University of Washington. She is a member of the UW Nbody Shop and uses cosmological simulations of galaxies to better understand galactic evolution. With her advisor, Professor Jessica Werk, Nicole is particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms which drive the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium, especially the effects of supermassive black hole feedback. Nicole will be defending her PhD next summer and is currently applying to Postdoc positions. When not busy with research, Nicole is the lead singer of Seattle’s premiere (and only) all-astronomer rock band, Night Lunch. <br>
